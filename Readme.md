# USP Exercises Questions Repository

Welcome to my repository of exercises from USP! This repository serves as a collection of programming questions from the website (https://www.ime.usp.br/~macmulti/exercicios/) that I have solved and practiced to improve my knowledge in C.

## Objective

The main objective of this repository is to:

- **Store Questions**: Store the programming questions from IME USP - Exercise Lists (Introduction to Computing) 

- **Track Progress**: Keep a record of my progress in solving these questions, including the source code, explanations, and any relevant notes.

- **Share Knowledge**: Share my solutions and knowledge with others who may find these questions helpful for learning and practicing programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Questions**: This folder contains subfolders for different categories or topics of programming questions from the List. Inside each subfolder, you will find the questions, source code solutions, and explanations where applicable.

- **Solutions**: In this section, you can find the source code solutions for the questions. Each solution is usually accompanied by comments explaining the approach and logic used.

- **Notes**: Here, I keep any additional notes, tips, or insights related to solving the questions. These notes can be helpful for understanding the concepts used in the solutions.

## How to Use This Repository

If you are also studying C and want to explore the questions or solutions, follow these steps:
